# Team C - XY drawings on the scope

## Objectives

- Use 2 Fastino channels to draw XY plots on the scope
- Implement simple animation (f.e. image scaling)

## Deliverable

- Setup description with connections drawing (DrawIO?)
- Experiment with arguments:
  - image type (enumeration, select from predefined)
  - animation speed (number)
- Experiment should store all generated image data in datasets
- Describe your implementation in your team's README.md
