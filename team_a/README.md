# Team A - Shaped RF pulse

## Objectives

- Use Urukul to generate shaped pulse (use on-chip RAM). Try to achieve pulses
  in us length range.
- Optionally initial phase should be given as a parameter.

## Deliverable

- Setup description with connections drawing (DrawIO?)
- Experiment with arguments:
  - shape (enumeration, predefined shape types)
  - pulse length (in us, scales shape)
  - (optionally) pulse initial phase
- Experiment should store shape envelope to dataset
- Describe your implementation in your team's README.md
